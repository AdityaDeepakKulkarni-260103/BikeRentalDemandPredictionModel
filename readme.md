Bike Rental Demand Prediction Model
##Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting bike rental demand using linear regression. The model forecasts the total number of rental bikes based on several key features, including season, weather, temperature, and user counts. The prediction helps optimize bike-sharing services by considering daily variations influenced by both environmental and user-driven factors.

##Dataset
The dataset used for this model is day.csv, containing the following fields:

instant: Record index
dteday: Date
season: Season (1: Spring, 2: Summer, 3: Fall, 4: Winter)
yr: Year (0: 2018, 1: 2019)
mnth: Month (1 to 12)
holiday: Whether the day is a holiday (1: Yes, 0: No)
weekday: Day of the week
workingday: Whether the day is a working day (1: Yes, 0: No)
weathersit: Weather situation (1: Clear, 2: Mist, 3: Light Snow, 4: Heavy Rain)
temp: Temperature in Celsius
atemp: Feels-like temperature in Celsius
hum: Humidity
windspeed: Wind speed
casual: Count of casual (non-registered) users
registered: Count of registered users
cnt: Total count of rental bikes (casual + registered)

##Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following performance metrics:

R-squared score: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE): Measures the percentage error in predictions.
Total Sum of Squares (TSS): Total variance in the target variable.
Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): Sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.
Coefficient of Determination (R-squared): Indicates how well the regression model fits the data.
Model Interpretation
The model predicts bike rental demand based on several features:

temp (temperature) has a significant positive effect on rental demand.
workingday has a positive correlation with bike rentals, indicating higher demand during working days.
season, particularly summer and spring, significantly influences the demand for bike rentals.

##Insights from Categorical Variables
Season: Summer and spring positively impact bike demand.
Holiday and Working Day: Holidays and non-working days generally lead to lower demand compared to working days.
Key Considerations
Dummy Variable Creation: We used drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity when creating dummy variables for categorical features. This ensures the model remains well-specified.
Feature Importance
The top 3 features contributing significantly to bike demand:

temp (temperature)
workingday
season
Assumptions Validation
We validated the assumptions of linear regression using the following checks:

Linearity: Assessed using pair-plots.
Homoscedasticity: Checked through residual plots.
Normality of residuals: Verified using Q-Q plots.
Multicollinearity: Examined through VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values.
